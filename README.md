My JS13K  2021 entry. 

I used the example at  [LostDecadeGames](http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/) for a start.
I looked at the JavaScript from the [Tululoo Game Maker](http://tululoo.com/) which I have used to make simple mobile games as a reference.  I used [ZZFX](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX/) to create/play audio in the game.  I Googled/Copy/Pasted with Lots
of trial, error, repeat for the rest.  By the time I was getting done I realized how I should have started.  It works on the few Androids and Iphones I have had the chance to test it on.  If I have time I will go back and do it better but my wife and kids are sick of me hunched over the laptop in the family room so it will probably have to wait.
